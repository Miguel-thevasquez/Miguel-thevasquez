### Hi there 👋
My name is Miguel Ángel Vásquez, I'm colombian and i'm a student who loves programming.
My first programming language is python. (well, is scratch or micro mundos but that was for school.)
I'm planning learn programming languages as much as i can and i want to make focus in AI develoment, robots desing, OS development, etc.
NOW LEARNING SMT32 AND PYTHON/MICROPYTHON AT THE SAME TIME @w@
